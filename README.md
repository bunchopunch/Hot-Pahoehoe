# HotPahoehoe

This repo is to showcase a Space Engineers voxel material that is experiencing odd rendering.

To install it, copy the folder in to your `C:\Users\<User Name>\AppData\Roaming\SpaceEngineers\Mods\Axio_PahoehoeHot` directory.

This matrial is under copyright and not open source. In the future, as I'm able to ensure it's stable, I hope to change that.
